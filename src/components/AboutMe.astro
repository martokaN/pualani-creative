          I'm a Maui-based lifestyle and wedding photographer with a heart for storytelling, sunlight, and real connection. Whether I'm capturing barefoot beach vows or cozy in-home family moments, my goal is always the same: to reflect your story in the most honest, heartfelt way possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I believe the magic is in the in-betweens — the wind in your hair, the uncontrollable laughs, the way your partner looks at you when you're not looking. That's what I chase with my camera. I work in natural light and soft tones to create images that feel like memories — warm, imperfect, and deeply personal.

          I've photographed people in canoes, on mountaintops, dancing in the rain, and snuggled in bed with coffee and dogs. No moment is too small to matter. When I'm not behind the lens, you'll find me sipping a vanilla chai, swimming in tidepools, or road-tripping across the islands with my husband and our rescue pup, Liko.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Photography is not just a job for me, it's an adventure, an art, and a lifelong passion. Every session is an opportunity to connect with incredible people and celebrate their unique stories. I can't wait to document yours.
